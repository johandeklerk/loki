= Installation

Clone the repo. Change into mary then

    bundle install

Same goes for gary.

= Mary

    rails s -p 5000

== Authentication

Using HTTP Basic Auth (see db/seeds for default username & password):

    GET http://localhost:5000/token

This provides you with a single access token that is valid for one hour.

In subsequent requests pass along this HTTP header:

    Authorizarion: Token token=thetokenthatwasprovided

Once the token expires, a 401 - Unauthorized will be returned. Simply request a new token with Basic auth to continue.

== Gary

    rails s
